# QA Engineer Test to Simetric

## Theory:

-   What are the limitations of Selenium testing?
-   What are the types of waits supported by WebDriver?
-   What is the major difference between driver.close() and driver.quit()
-   Can Captcha be automated?
-   What does the switchTo() command do?
-   When do we use findElement() and findElements()?
-   Explain how API testing differs from unit testing.
-   How do APIs work?
-   What are the advantages of API Testing?
-   What are the advantages of UI Testing?
-   What is Latency in API testing?
-   List the most common status code that can response an API

## Practice:

-   Design and develop a script to find broken links in Selenium WebDriver
-   Implement a configuration to launch a test with Google Chrome and Firefox (do not necessarily have to run in parallel).
-   Create a test to validate the success response and the schema response of the next Python code:

```python
import requests
url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"
response = requests.request("GET", url)
```

-   Implement a method to find elements into a webElement.
-   Taking as an example the html of the image, design a css selector to get the text of the h2 and p tag (marked with the red box)

**PD**: All scripts should be uploaded to a git project on GitHub on a public repository, preferably using Python as programming language.
